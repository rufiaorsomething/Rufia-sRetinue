A Balatro mod all about my little personal pantheon. This is an Alpha Release, so a lot of the artwork still needs work, and I can't promise there won't be bugs, but I judged it a complete enough package to release into the wild.

As of Febuary 2025, This mod currently includes:
- 11 Jokers
- 2 Vouchers
- 3 Enhancements
- 4 Editions
- and 3 Consumables



To run this mod you will require:

[Lovely Injector](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) - [(Download)](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector/releases/tag/v0.7.1)

[Steamodded 1.0.0~ALPHA-1401a](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/tree/f6ce426d8c5def59303fb8a8927596826eb9037c) - [(Download)](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/archive/f6ce426d8c5def59303fb8a8927596826eb9037c.zip)

If you're new to Balatro modding, I'd also like to recommend [Galdur](https://github.com/Eremel/Galdur), [Cartomancer](https://github.com/stupxd/Cartomancer) and [Handy](https://github.com/SleepyG11/HandyBalatro) as Quality of Life mods, but I will leave you to explore the wide world of Balatro content mods on your own.

If you're unsure where to look, the official Balatro discord or the Modded Balatro wiki can be good places to start.
